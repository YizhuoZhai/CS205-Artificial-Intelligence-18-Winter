## Learning Summary
  This class covers three main section :1) Search 2) Machine Learning 3)Knowledge Representation <br />
### Search: <br />
  1) Blind Search introduces the two components in search: states and operations.<br />
  2) Heuristc Search makes the search more quickly and accurate: A* algorithm. <br />
  3) Adversarial Search assume we have adversaries: Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning. <br />
### Machine Learning <br />
  1) Simple Linear Classifier: linear time to construct, constant time to use. <br />
  2) Nearest Neighbor Classifier: sensitve to irrelevant features. <br />
     Feature Selection. <br />
  3) Decision Tree Classifier: splitting criteria: information gain, etc. <br />
  4) Clustering with Partition Algorithm: K-means, K-medoids, birch algorithm. <br />
  5) Clustering with Hierarchical Algorithm: Bottom-up: agglomerative. <br />
     Term: dendrogram <br />
    Distance between two clusters: single/complete/group average/words linkage. <br />
  6) Nearest Neighbor Clustering: best for time series. <br />
### Knowledge Representation <br />
  1) Propositional Logic: Truth Tables and Using Inference Rule. <br />
  2) First Order Logic: Substitution with GMP (not complete), resolution refutation (complete). <br />
     Horn Form: a conjunction of atomic sentences on the left side, while a single atome on the right side. <br />
